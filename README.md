Orbiter is a server that collects and redistributes webhooks over the network.

## Features

- Receive and save webhook by time, type (GitHub, etc) and tags (repository, owner, etc).
- Redistribute webhook by RESTful APIs whenever and whatever it gets requested.
- Nice admin dashboard to config and do statistics.

## WTF?

Oh well, it is just a tool to collect webhook history when you don't have time to process them all at the moment.

Or, maybe you want to study later.

And nothing else, sorry!
